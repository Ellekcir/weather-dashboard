# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was created to provide the user with the weather forecast, it features a current weather update and a 5 day forecast, and has a log of previous searches for convenience to flick between different cities. This project was a good learing curve in my web developing journey as I learnt alot about how to use an API and improved on javascript features.

## Features


## Usage

This project gives the user the ability to search for a city retrieve current and future conditions for that city and then the city is added to the search history through the use of Local Storage.
When viewing current weather conditions for that city, the user will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
with additional future weather conditions for a 5-day forecast that also displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they shall then be presented with current and future conditions for that city again.
